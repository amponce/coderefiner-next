Project: CodeRefiner – AI-Powered Code Optimization and Refactoring Tool

Objective:
Build a full-stack SaaS application, CodeRefiner, that uses advanced AI agents to help developers audit, optimize, refactor, and document their codebases. The product must integrate seamlessly with GitHub via OAuth, allow workspace configuration, provide detailed analysis and actionable recommendations, support interactive framework migrations, and enable real-time collaboration—all while maintaining tight security and scalability.

Features & Requirements:

1. GitHub Integration:
   - Implement secure OAuth authentication to allow single/multi-account GitHub connections.
   - Fetch and list user repositories and branches.
   - Allow import of repository data for subsequent analysis.

2. Workspace & Repository Configuration:
   - Build an intuitive UI that lets users select which repositories and directories/files to include or exclude for scanning.
   - Display a folder/file-tree structure with easy toggling options.

3. Multi-Agent System:
   - **Redundancy Agent:** Detect and flag unused files, functions, components, and assets. Generate recommendations for removal or archiving.
   - **Code Review Agent:** Analyze code for complexity, readability issues, anti-patterns, and provide actionable improvement suggestions.
   - **Optimization Agent:** Identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, and memory issues. Offer detailed optimization strategies.
   - **Modularization Agent:** Detect complex or monolithic components and provide step-by-step instructions to refactor them into modular, reusable pieces.
   - **Documentation Agent:** Automatically generate up-to-date markdown documentation covering architecture, component APIs, dependency trees, and usage examples.
   - **Framework Migration Agent:** Provide an interactive, guided flow for migrating between frameworks (e.g., React → Next.js, Vue → React), including routing, state management, SSR/SSG, and styling transitions.
   - **Security Scan Agent:** Continuously monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies and code; deliver automated recommendations for secure coding practices.
   - **Package Maintenance Agent:** Scan for outdated npm packages and offer migration guides with step-by-step prompts for updates (e.g., Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind).
   - **Testing Agent:** Analyze test coverage, identify missing tests based on best practices, and integrate with popular testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Cypress, Testing Library).
   - **Autonomous Refactoring Agent:** Once recommendations are approved, automatically apply refactoring changes following approved patterns and project conventions.
   - **Adaptive Learning:** Enable agents to learn from user feedback and overrides, refining future recommendations accordingly.

4. Interactive Repository Insights & Collaboration:
   - Develop a dynamic dashboard displaying critical metrics such as commit frequency, pull request stats, code churn, and complexity hotspots.
   - Enable team collaboration with shared views, audit trails, and commenting on recommendations.
   - Provide historical trends and improvement suggestions over time.

5. Workflow & User Flow:
   - **User Authentication & Onboarding:** Start with GitHub OAuth authentication and a simple onboarding wizard that guides the user through initial workspace configuration.
   - **Agent Selection & Configuration:** Allow users to select which AI agents to run and configure parameters (e.g., complexity thresholds, optimization levels).
   - **Initial Code Audit:** Immediately trigger a comprehensive audit using the selected agents; generate a summary report highlighting redundant files, complexity issues, optimization opportunities, etc.
   - **Detailed Recommendations & Execution:** Let users explore detailed agent results, view actionable recommendations, and see tailored prompts that work with IDE-integrated tools (e.g., Cursor).
   - **Interactive Framework Migration:** If needed, guide the user through a step-by-step interactive migration process, handling component refactoring, routing, data fetching, and state management changes with continuous feedback.
   - **Automated Documentation Generation:** Post significant changes/migrations, automatically generate updated documentation that details component APIs, dependencies, and usage.
   - **Security & Maintenance Alerts:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies, notifying the user when action is required.
   - **Autonomous Refactoring (Optional):** For users opting in, allow the system to automatically apply approved refactorings and migrations.

6. Technical Stack & Deployment:
   - **Frontend:** Build with React and Next.js for SSR, SSG, and optimal performance.
   - **Backend:** Use Node.js (Express) to implement server-side logic, integrate with AI services, and handle webhook events.
   - **Database:** Choose PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user configurations, audit logs, and agent feedback.
   - **AI Integration:** Leverage external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI models) for code analysis, prompt generation, and adaptive learning capabilities.
   - **Hosting & Deployment:** Deploy on scalable platforms (e.g., Vercel for the frontend, AWS/Heroku for the backend) ensuring high availability and performance.
   - **Security:** Implement best practices for handling user code and sensitive data, including encryption, secure OAuth flows, and regular vulnerability assessments.
   - **CI/CD:** Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines to facilitate rapid iteration and testing.

7. Business Model & Monetization:
   - Position CodeRefiner as a premium, subscription-based service.
   - Offer tiered plans based on the number of integrations, teams, and advanced features such as autonomous refactoring.
   - Include detailed analytics and reporting as part of the enterprise plans.

Deliverables:
   - A fully integrated, production-ready codebase for CodeRefiner.
   - Comprehensive documentation, including a README, setup instructions, and API docs.
   - A clear guide for GitHub OAuth integration, user onboarding, and real-time collaboration features.
   - An interactive demo showcasing the audit, agent configuration, and migration flows.
